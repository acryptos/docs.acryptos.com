# Strategies

Our Vault strategies strive to maintain very tight positions around stable / pegged pools (e.g. 1-tick / 0.01% range on USDC/USDT), and wider rages on more volatile pools. APY are significantly higher compared to [similar protocols](https://defillama.com/protocols/liquidity%20manager) building on the same pools.

In comparison with other concentrated liquidity managers, our strategies have outperformed in yield generation for the exact same pools managed. Attached below is a [historical chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acryptos/docs.acryptos.com/master/images/History%20-%20Arbitrum%20USDC-DAI.jpg) for the yields generated by our managed USDC-DAI pool on UniswapV3 (Arbitrum) for the period of 18 Dec '23 to 18 Jan '24

* 3.13% yield in 30 days
* potentially extrapolated to 38.08% APR
