# $BNB - Native Liquid Staking Vault

The **first** _**native**_ liquid staking BNB product on BSC, launched on 9 Feb 2023.

Featuring fully automated, on-chain de-centralized operations, utilizing the [new native staking system contract on BSC](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002001), implemented via [BEP-153](https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP153.md).

The use of the native staking system contract means that all operations between BSC and BC are performed on-chain, providing a transparent and secure process.

This Vault is a [Liquidizer Vault](liquidizer-vaults.md) and a reserve of BNB is kept on BSC to enable immediate withdrawals. When reserves run low, an undelegation is triggered on BC to automatically top them up, subject to the 7-day unbonding period.
