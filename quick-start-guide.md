## Vault Comparisons

You see some great yields on our dapp: there's [Single-Token](products/vaults/) vaults, and [ACLM](products/v3-aclm-vaults/) vaults - but you're not too sure which to pick. What are the _risks involved_? What tokens do you _receive as APY_? etc.

**This will help you out.** ðŸ‘‡

* WMATIC
* WETH
* WBNB
* WBTC
* tBTC
* BTCB

IL is relatively lower than other pairs as prices for large marketcap tokens generally move in the same direction.

_\*Take note that IL may negate any gains, or result in losses on the intial deposit. Refer to the_ [_History Graph_](products/v3-aclm-vaults/advanced-functions.md#graph-history) _in the Advanced section of each vault to evaluate their past performance._

Link: [https://app.acryptos.com/vaults/?a=lp-a](https://app.acryptos.com/vaults/?a=lp-a)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LP-B" %}
A category of ACLM vaults, consisting of smaller marketcap tokens paired with large marketcap tokens.

_\*Liquidity for our ACryptoS_ [_governance token pair_](dao/acs.md) _ACS / WBNB can be found in this category as well._

Some of the tokens available:

* BSW, LODE, VELA, THALES, GMX, XVS, PEPE, CAKE, MAGIC, TIA.n, CRV, UNI, LINK

IL may be higher for these pairs as prices tend to fluctuate much more for lower marketcap tokens.

_\*Take note that IL may negate any gains, or result in losses on the intial deposit. Refer to the_ [_History Graph_](products/v3-aclm-vaults/advanced-functions.md#graph-history) _in the Advanced section of each vault to evaluate their past performance._

**Examples:**

**ACLM - Volatile Strategies**

* CAKE / WBNB on PancakeswapV3 (BSC)
* LINK / WETH on UniswapV3 (Arbitrum)
* PEPE / WETH on UniswapV3 (Arbitrum)
* CRV / WETH on UniswapV3 (Arbitrum)
* UNI / WETH on UniswapV3 (Arbitrum)
* BSW / WBNB on BiswapV3 (BSC)

Link: [https://app.acryptos.com/vaults/?a=lp-b](https://app.acryptos.com/vaults/?a=lp-b)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LP-C" %}
A category of ACLM vaults, consisting of stablecoin tokens paired with mainly large marketcap tokens.

IL may be **very high** for these pairs as fluctuating token prices are amplified when paired with stablecoin tokens.

_\*Take note that IL may negate any gains, or result in losses on the intial deposit. Refer to the_ [_History Graph_](products/v3-aclm-vaults/advanced-functions.md#graph-history) _in the Advanced section of each vault to evaluate their past performance._

**Examples:**

**ACLM - Volatile Strategies**

* WBNB / USDT on UniswapV3 (BSC)
* wstETH / USDC.e on UniswapV3 (Arbitrum)
* MATIC / USDT on UniswapV3 (Polygon)
* WETH / USDbC on UniswapV3 (Base)
* WETH / USDC on SushiswapV3 (Arbitrum)

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LP-FIAT" %}
A category of stablecoins from different currencies, paired with the USD stablecoin.

IL is minimal, as pegged fiat currencies are much less volatile than other crypto tokens. Token unpeg risk has to be factored in as part of risk assessment as well.

* XSGD [by StraitsX](https://www.straitsx.com/xsgd)
* EURC [by Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/eurc)

**ACLM - Volatile Strategies**

## Risks

DeFi risks are very high compared to traditional finance, ranging widely from market factors to contract exploits. Here are some risks for consideration along with possible mitigations. Factor in your own risk appetite when deciding on which vaults to deposit your tokens in.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only put in funds you can afford to lose. Do not risk your life savings on DeFi.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>General Smart Contract Risks</summary>

Smart contracts are vulnerable to exploits. These exploits can result in significant financial losses or other negative consequences. It's crucial to understand the risks involved and avoid interacting with contracts from untrusted sources.

ACryptoS has focused on safety and careful risk assessment since deployment in 2020. Multiple [audits](dao/security-and-risks.md#audits) and a [bug bounty](dao/bug-bounty.md) serve to enhance the security. Read our blog here to understand [what sets us apart](https://medium.com/acryptos/what-sets-acryptos-apart-d6345e2f5d7f).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Vaults - Underlying Protocol Risks</summary>

* our Single-Token vaults are built on top of lending protocols. They run the risk where the underlying protocols are exploited, and funds siphoned out via exploiters. We aim to filter out projects via thorough internal due diligence procedures, and try our best to build on safe credible protocols. Over the years since our deployment, despite our best efforts, there have been a few of these protocols exploited with funds unrecoverable (read: [Atlantis](https://t.me/acryptos/1/230896), [Channels](https://t.me/acryptos/1/238945), [Sonne](https://medium.com/@SonneFinance/post-mortem-sonne-finance-exploit-12f3daa82b06))
* our ACLM vaults are built on top of V3 Conc Liquidity DEXs. In order to minimize the risks of exploits on the underlying DEX, we aim to only build on stronger and battle-tested DEXs like Uniswap, Sushi, and Pancakeswap.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stablecoin Depeg Risks</summary>

* protocols issuing USD stablecoins claim to be pegged to USD 1:1, but many smaller marketcap stablecoins are at a high risk of depegging. It may be due to the mechanics behind how the stablecoin is backed, or due to market sentiments resulting in sell-offs, etc.
* larger stablecoins like USDC, USDT, DAI, etc have lower depeg risks, though there have been multiple depegging issues over the years as well

</details>

<details>

<summary>LST/LRT Protocol Risks</summary>

* liquid staking tokens tend to be quite centralized, where user funds like ETH or BNB are held by the intermediary protocol, and staking is done on their back end.
* Risks involve protocol exploits, intentional draining of funds, or "depegging" of liquid staked tokens . Lack of liquidity might affect the unstaking of liquid tokens back to the native token as well.
* eg. rETH, wstETH, cbETH, stkBNB, ankrBNB, BNBx etc.
* please DYOR on how credible and transparent the staking protocols are, as well as how large the market of these tokens are

<summary>Bridged Token Risks</summary>

* it is essential to understand the difference between native tokens and bridged tokens on various chains. Bridged tokens are susceptible to risks and exploits of the bridging protocol itself.&#x20;
* eg. USDC.e is a bridged token while USDC is the native token that is issued directly by Circle. The native USDC token can be redeemed 1:1 to USD via Circle.
* eg. Multichain bridge was exploited on multiple chains in 2023. Funds that were lost due to that incident has not been recovered since.

<summary>Wrapped Token Risks</summary>

Wrapped tokens, while offering convenience, can pose risks. The underlying asset's security and the wrapping platform's reliability are crucial factors. Be cautious of potential vulnerabilities and always research before investing in wrapped tokens.

eg. WBTC is wrapped by BitGo, cbBTC is wrapped by Coinbase etc.&#x20;
