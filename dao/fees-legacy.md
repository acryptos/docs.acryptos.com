### ACS and ACSI Governance Vaults

Staking in the Governance Vaults earns you a share of all protocol fees. The ACS Vault earns withdrawal and performance fees from our Vaults, and the ACSI Vault earns exchange fees from our StableSwap. They also earn their respective Farm harvest fees, and token emissions rewards (33.33% of Farm emissions).

Only ACS and ACSI staked in the Governance Vaults can participate in Governance.

Staking in the Governance Vaults represents a commitment to the protocol, and instead of a time lock, there is a significant withdrawal fee.

#### Farm Rewards Boost

Governance Vault holdings are used to boost ACS / ACSI Farm rewards by up to 2.5X. [More info](acryptos-farms.md#acs-farms-v2).

**Governance Vault withdrawal fee:** 10% (distributed to ACS / ACSI holders - remains in vault)

Governance Vault tokens (acsACS / acsACSI) are non-transferrable. You will have to withdraw to transfer.
