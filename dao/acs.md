### Bridge & Migration

* **Bridge ACS:** [https://app.acryptos.com/acs/bridge/](https://app.acryptos.com/acs/bridge/)\
  $ACS is native on BNB Chain. It can be used in a number of other chains through our bridge, developed via LayerZero.
* **Migrate ACS:** [https://app.acryptos.com/acs/migrate/](https://app.acryptos.com/acs/migrate/)\
  $ACS has been updated to a new token contract. This is due to a Multichain issue in 2023. Please migrate any of your original $ACS to the new contract. See below for full details.

### Tokenomics

$ACS emissions was initially supply capped at 1,888,888 tokens. Tokenomics was upgraded in July 2023 to cut off all emissions.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Current total supply can be tracked on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/acryptos/).
{% endhint %}

Fees collected from all ACryptoS vaults go to ACryptoS [Treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x5bd97307a40dfbfdbaef4b3d997adb816f2dadcc) with periodical Buyback and Burning of the ACS token. Adding to the fact that there are no longer any ACS emissions, this results in a deflationary model for the $ACS token, benefiting ACS holders in the long term.

There is no $ACS vault staking. Users only need to hold the token in their wallet to receive the benefits from Buyback and Burn.

For users looking to pair $ACS into a liquidity pool for earning swap fees or token farming, existing pools can be found in the [Liquidity](acs.md#liquidity) section above.

_\*All parameters may be adjusted in future via governance._

<summary><strong>Multichain.org Incident - July 2023</strong></summary>

The Multichain.org bridge stopped working on 7 July 2023 following abnormal movements of locked assets. \~170K of bridged ACS was stuck and under the control of unknown entities. An announcement was made to ask users to remove ACS paired liquidity as a migration plan was being worked on. A governance vote was taken to [approve the migration](https://vote.acryptos.com/#/proposal/0x16b1bcf3b151f9de38b151616f5d83bfdc2415a677cd5953ec1be2d0343009e1).

A new ACS token is deployed at 0x8888888888f004100C0353d657BE6300587A6CcD across several chains.

The new token was designed with certain features to mitigate bridging risks:

* Bridging is achieved by passing cross chain messages. This is using Layer Zero initially, and can be upgraded to use any combination of protocols.
* ACryptoS Dev team controls new token contracts including the ability to pause and blacklist in the event of bridge / messaging protocol exploit.
* Bridged balances are reconciled on the canonical chain (BSC). Bridging can only be done to/from the canonical chain, and will fail if they cannot be reconciled (i.e. more balance bridged in than has been bridged out).

There is a [migration](acs.md#bridge-and-migration) feature which will allow users to migrate 1:1 the old/Multichain.org ACS tokens. Migration will be paused if the contract detects abnormal changes in the locked Multichain.org ACS tokens.
