# FAQ

## Trading/Listing, Supply Cap

### 1. What is ACS and what is ACSI? What are their core products?

* ACS is the native token of ACryptoS \(connected with all the Vaults farming on PCS and Venus Protocol\), while ACSI is the native token of the StableSwap.
* The core product of ACS is yield farming optimizers for multiple types of tokens. 

  The core product of ACSI is the StableSwap, which is an automated market maker.

### 2. Where is ACS listed and traded?

* ACS is currently listed on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/acryptos/), [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/acryptos), the [MATH dApp Store](https://mathdapp.store) and traded on the [Pancakeswap Exchange](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x4197C6EF3879a08cD51e5560da5064B773aa1d29).

### 3. Is the ACS supply capped?

* For now there is no cap on the supply, however this can be changed in future with governance.

  There are also mechanisms in place to keep the ACS price stable and to stop the sell pressure.

### 4. How many tokens are minted per day?

* Currently there is a constant daily emission rate of ~3669 ACS tokens.

  ~2560 ACS to the farms, +33.33% to ACS Vault, +10% reward to the dev team.

  The genesis mining is ~8888 ACS.

### 5. Are the tokenomic models of ACS and ACSI sustainable?

* For ACS: the performance and withdrawal fees gained from providing the yield farming services to users are used to buy-back ACS from the market and then the ACS is redistributed to the ACS Stakers. This ensures a sustainable future of ACS.
* For ACSI: 50% of the fees gained from stablecoin swap is used to buy-back ACSI from the market and then the ACS is redistributed to the ACSI Stakers. This ensures a sustainable future of ACSI.

### 6. What is the vision of ACS and ACSI

* The vision of ACS is to be the YFI on the Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\).
* The vision of ACSI is to be the Curve \(Crv\) on the Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\).

## Security

### 1. Are the contracts behind a timelock?

* Yes, the contracts are behind a 6 hours timelock.

### 2. Are the contracts verified?

* Yes. All deployed contracts have [verified and published source codes on BscScan](https://app.acryptos.com/contracts/).

### 3. Is the project audited?

* Not yet since it is quite expensive but we are trying to do that. It will be in near future, with the help of the treasury/grants.

## Fees

### 1. Is there a Deposit fee?

* No.

### 2. What are the withdrawal fees?

* There is a 0.5% withdrawal fee. This fee is applied on all vaults \(except the ACS Vault\).
* For the ACS Vault, the withdrawal fee is 10% \(applied only on the amount you withdraw\).

  Example: If you have 1000 ACS in the ACS Vault, and you decide to withdraw 100 ACS, the fee will be 10 ACS.

### 3. What are the harvest fees on the farms?

* The harvest fee is 10 ACS. Note: Clicking the stake/unstake button also triggers the harvest \(on the ACS Vaults&Farms\).

  If you harvest when your Pending ACS is less than 10 ACS, the Pending amount resets to 0.

### 4. What are the performance and the workers fee?

* The performance fee is 5% and the workers fee is 0.3% \(on the profit\). These fees are already reflected in the shown APR.

### 5. Which fees are visible and which are already included in the APR?

* The vault’s performance fee and workers fee \(5% + 0.3%\) are already included in the APR you see, so no need to do any math on that.
* You only need to be careful with the farms’ harvest fee \(10 ACS\), the vaults' withdrawal fee \(0.5%\), and the withdrawal fee on the ACS Vault \(10%\).

### 6. What are the fees on the StableSwap?

* The exchange fees are set to 0.04%, which is almost 10 times cheaper than the 0.3+% charged by all the other UniSwap and SushiSwap clones.

  All this is thanks to Curve’s [specialized algorithm tailored for trading of stablecoins and other pegged assets](https://www.curve.fi/stableswap-paper.pdf).

### 7. What is the difference between APR and APY?

* APR reflects the simple interest rate over a year’s time \(APR/365\), while APY describes the rate with the effect of compounding.

## Technical and UI

### 1. What is the difference between Deposit \(Vault\) and Stake \(Farm\)?

* When you Deposit tokens to a Vault, the staked tokens start to auto-compound right away. 
* When you Stake those same tokens, you start earning ACS.

### 2. Does ACS auto-compound?

* Yes, ACS auto-compounds in the ACS Vault. 

  If you have Pending ACS in one of the other Vaults, you first need to harvest them and transfer them to the ACS Vault.

### 3. How the auto-compounding works \(and what is the Workers tab\)?

* Currently there is a bot that automatically does that couple times a day. 
* There is also a Workers tab, where anyone can manually harvest each Vault \(and get the associated fee\).

  The Workers tab is just a backup, the normal user does not have to use it.

### 4. When does the ACS buy-back happen?

* The ACS buy-back happens when the bot harvests the ACS Vault. 

  When this happens, all the tokens gained from performance and withdrawal fees are first transferred to BNB, and then to ACS. 

  Then the ACS is distributed to the ACS Vault stakers.

### 5. How the Venus strategies work?

* By supplying assets and borrowing the same asset to resupply with.

  Example: Supply BNB, borrow BNB, supply more BNB, borrow more BNB, and repeat.

  With this method you are earning both supply and borrow rewards, with minimal liquidation risk as we are using a single asset.

### 6. Why does the APR on some Vaults show weird numbers?

* The UI shows the average APR of the last 3 days. 

  So if a Vault is new, the numbers could be off.

### 7. I cannot find the “harvest” or “withdraw” button, where are they?

* The User interface \(UI\) is dynamic. The harvest button appears after you have at least 10 ACS Pending for harvest.
* If your assets are Staked, the Withdraw button appears after the Unstake.

### 8. What is ACS4USD and what is ACS4VAI?

* When you deposit Stable coins to the ACS4USD StableSwap, you receive ACS4
* When you deposit Stable coins to the ACS4VAI StableSwap, you receive ACS4VAI.

  Then you can then stake those ACS4 / ACS4VAI in the ACS4USD / ACS4VAI farms to earn ACSI.

## Governance and Voting

### 1. Is there a treasury?

* Yes. A vote for adding 3% from the daily mint to a treasury passed. 

### 2. What is the main goal of the treasury?

* The treasury funds will be used to improve the project \(marketing/pr/administration/management/insurance/etc\).

### 3. Who controls the treasury?

* The treasury will be controlled via governance.

### 4. Am I eligible to vote and where do I vote?

* If you hold acsACS, you are eligible to vote on [the voting platform](https://vote.acryptos.com/#/acryptos/all).

### 5. How do I get acsACS?

* When you stake ACS in the ACS Vault, you receive acsACS.

  acsACS is your voting power.

### 6. Who can create a vote?

* Anyone who holds at least 88 acsACS.
