* **ACLM Vaults:** Simplified liquidity providing for V3 pools. **Stable Strategies** (eg. USDC/DAI or wstETH/ETH) offer _attractive APYs for relatively low risks_, while **Volatile Strategies** (eg. ETH-USDC) help users manage & rebalance their positions on V3 LPs, _reducing the burdens_ of constantly monitoring their holdings.
