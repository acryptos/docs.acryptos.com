* SAFU, careful risk management
* sustainable APY & tokenomics

## Products

### ($ACS) 1. Single-Token Autocompounding Vaults (Multi-Chain)

Single token vaults are one of the most unique offerings at ACryptoS. We partner with and build on lending protocols, using our smart contract strategies to automatically leverage the same token.

By borrowing and supplying the same token in a number of loops, users earn Supply and Borrow APY multiple times, up to 7.6X the initial APY. This helps users get much higher yields for their tokens, and also increases the deposits and utilizations of lending markets.

There is zero liquidation risk in our strategy, as it is using the same token for supplying and borrowing. Price movements of the token does not result in liquidations. Read more about risks here.

### ($ACSI) 2. ACryptoS StableSwap (Stablecoin DEX)

ACryptoS StableSwap is an [automated market maker (AMM)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) protocol based on Curve’s specialized algorithm tailored for stable coins. ACryptoS is offering the first AMM for stable coins based on this algorithm on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

Trading on the Binance Smart Chain is both faster and significantly cheaper than trading on the Ethereum chain. ERC-20 Tokens can be crossed over from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain via the Binance Bridge.

Acryptos StableSwap enables efficient stablecoin trading at best prices which is

* **\~10x cheaper**;
* **\~100x less slippage** when trading stable coins compared to the various UniSwap type AMMs available.
