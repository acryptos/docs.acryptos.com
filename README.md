## ACryptoS - Advanced Crypto Strategies

ACryptoS is a multi-chain Yield Farming Optimizer & DEX, with a set of unique products deployed to support DeFi users and protocols. Originally launched on BNB Chain in Nov 2020, ACryptoS is now on 11 chains, with more than 100+ vaults deployed.

Yield Farming Optimizer products range from Autocompounding Single-token Vaults, 2-token LP Vaults, to one-of-a-kind Liquid Vaults. Other products include a Balancer-V2 forked DEX, and a Stablecoin swap.

### Core Values

- unique, smart, automated DeFi strategies
- SAFU, careful risk management
- sustainable APY & tokenomics

## Products

### 1. Single-Token Autocompounding Vaults (Multi-Chain)

Single token vaults are one of the most unique offerings at ACryptoS. We partner with and build on lending protocols, using our smart contract strategies to automatically leverage the same token.

By borrowing and supplying the same token in a number of loops, users earn Supply and Borrow APY multiple times, up to 7.6X the initial APY. This helps users get much higher yields for their tokens, and also increases the deposits and utilizations of lending markets.

There is zero liquidation risk in our strategy, as it is using the same token for supplying and borrowing. Price movements of the token does not result in liquidations.
Read more about risks here.

Our single-token vaults provide these benefits to users:
i. autocompounding
- vaults compound automatically through our smart contract strategy
- staked tokens increase over time
ii. no IL (impermanent loss)
- single token staking, no impermanent loss as per LP farming
iii. automated, no harvesting required
- APY is in staked tokens, not from farming emission tokens
iv. SAFU
- we filter and partner with quality protocols, putting our priorities on user fund safety
- no security issues since 2020 launch

11 chains, 100+ vaults

*If you see your staked tokens "trickle" to a lower amount at certain times, do not worry as it is normal and part of how our strategy works. Funds are SAFU, and your tokens are still autocompounding as intended. Read here to understand more.

### 2. Single-Token Liquid Vaults (Multi-Chain)

ACryptoS offers three products on the Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\).

[Frequently Asked Questions](faq.md)

[Guide and Tutorials to get started on ACryptoS](community.md#guides-tutorials-intros)

### 1. ACryptoS Vaults \(Yield Farming Optimizer\)

ACryptoS Vaults grow your assets \(tokens\) via automated Yield Strategies.

The Vaults achieve highest possible yields through:

1. Unparalleled creative automation strategies
2. Optimal compounding frequency
3. Highly efficient gas utilisation

When you deposit into a Vault, your tokens will grow over time at the fastest optimized yield through automations.

This means you will be able to enjoy the benefits of autocompounding without additional steps. There is no need to manually harvest the Vault.

### ACryptoS Farms

ACryptoS Farms are the places where native tokens of ACryptoS, [ACS and ACSI tokens are distributed](fees.md#tokenomics).

Once assets are deposited into a Vault or StableSwap product, users have the **option to Stake** the vault or liquidity tokens they receive back respectively into the corresponding farm.

ACryptoS Vault tokens will yield ACS, and ACryptoS StableSwap Liquidity Provider tokens will yield ACSI as reward in their respective farms.This further enhances the yield on your deposits.

Things to note for Farms:

* You will need to **Stake** your Vault or Liquidity tokens in the Vaults to farm the native tokens. \(ACS/ACSI\). 
* **Farms do not** automatically compound and require **manual harvesting** \(through the Harvest Button\) by the user.
* [Auto-compounding ACS Vault and ACSI Vault](https://app.acryptos.com/core/) for already harvested or purchased ACS and ACSI tokens are offered on the platform as well.

### 2. ACryptoS StableSwap \(Stablecoin DEX\)

ACryptoS StableSwap is an [automated market maker \(AMM\)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) protocol based on Curveâ€™s specialized algorithm tailored for stable coins. ACryptoS is offering the first AMM for stable coins based on this algorithm on the Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\).

Trading on the Binance Smart Chain is both faster and significantly cheaper than trading on the Ethereum chain. ERC-20 Tokens can be crossed over from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain via the Binance Bridge.

Acryptos StableSwap enables efficient stablecoin trading at best prices which is

* **~10x cheaper**;
* **~100x less slippage** when trading stable coins compared to the various UniSwap type AMMs available.

### ACS and ACSI Native Tokens

1. ACS is our native token of our yield farming optimizer ACryptoS Vaults.

   ACS tokens deposited in the [**ACS Vault**](https://app.acryptos.com/core/):

   * accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from Vaults and ACS Farms
   * participate in the [governance of the protocol](https://vote.acryptos.com/).
   * give you [yield boost](acryptos-farms.md#acs-rewards-boost) in the ACS related farms

2. ACSI is the native token of **StableSwap** and probably all future non-vault products.

   ACSI tokens deposited in the [**ACSI Vault**](https://app.acryptos.com/core/):

   * accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from [StableSwap and ACSI Farms](https://app.acryptos.com/acsi/)
   * and participate in the [governance of the protocol](https://vote.acryptos.com/).

### Tokenomics and Fees

Our tokenomics and fees are designed to encourage

1. Longer term staking
2. Reward long term holders of ACS and ACSI.

This means if you enter and exit quickly as a liquidity provider, you will likely earn 0 or even a slightly negative return.

Please carefully review our documentation on [fees](fees.md) before proceeding.
